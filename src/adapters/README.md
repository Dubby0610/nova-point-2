# Preamble
This document provides detailed guidance for protocol developers interested in integrating their decentralized applications (dApps), decentralized exchanges (DEXes), or other protocols with the zkLink ecosystem to leverage the Nova points incentive system. By following this guide, developers can create compatible adapters, format data submissions and understand the integration workflow.

## Goal
The main purpose of this integration is to enable protocols that have successfully integrated with the zkLink Nova system to automatically allocate Nova points to their users.

As the final verification step in this integration process, we will conduct a rigorous comparison between the CSV file generated by your adapter and the actual on-chain data obtained from your contract deployed on the zkLink network.

This comparison is crucial to ensure the accuracy and consistency of the data before finalizing the integration and activating point allocation.

Once the verification is successful, zkLink will start distributing Nova points to users.

## Getting Started

### Sample Adapter
Check this [example](./example/)

You can use a subgraph or an existing service to process adapter data.

**Requirements:**
- You must provide an **npm project** with the correct npm dependencies included in the **package.json** and output an executable Node.js script in _dist/index_.
- This script contains a function with the signature `function getUserBalanceByBlock(blockNumber: number, blockTimestamp: number): void`, which takes *blockNumber* and *blockTimestamp* as a parameter to execute the script and outputs a CSV file.
- In the output CSV file, you need to include snapshot data of all users within the protocol at this *blockNumber*.

## Installation & Setup
If you utilize subgraph on Nova network, you must include the subgraph package in the project directory.

The zkLink Nova network is not yet supported in The Graph's list of supported networks. As a result, to create a subgraph on the zkLink Nova network, it is necessary to set up your own hosted service. We have already set up a functional hosted service specifically for creating subgraphs on the zkLink Nova network. Please note the following requirements before proceeding:

- We will provide you with the deployment scripts necessary for local development. However, you need to set a secret environment variable to distinguish the deployment path from other projects and prevent it from being arbitrarily overwritten. see [env](#how-to-deploy-and-test-your-own-subgraph)
- Once the deployment is complete, teams must upload their source code to the **subgraph** directory. 
- We will deploy it from our repository to our official production environment.

### How to deploy and test your own subgraph?

Then check the **.env.example** file in the **subgraph** folder of your project, create your own **.env** file, and change the `SUBGRAPH_PATH_SECRET` to a random value which is known only within your team.

```bash
cd src/adapters/<project folder>/subgraph/ && cp .env.example .env
```

### Launch
Return to the root directory of the adapters, you can use this script to deploy subgraph onto Nova subgraph service. Execute the deploySubgraph.js script with the following command:

```bash
cd src/adapters/<project folder>/ && node ../deploySubgraph.js --directory <project folder>
```
Upon successful deployment, a subgraph URL will be returned and displayed in your terminal.


## Building the Adapter

### Data requirement
Capture a snapshot every 8 hours at 02:00 UTC, 10:00 UTC, and 18:00 UTC of the Total Value Locked (TVL) distributed by assets per user on a daily basis.

### Output data schema (example)
| Data Field | Notes                                                              |
| --------   | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| userAddress     | 0xe75FF0b77c1859AC30EB1EEBC53C5BAdD28d19F7 |
| tokenAddress   | 0x2F8A25ac62179B31D62D7F80884AE57464699059 |
| poolAddress     | Each poolâ€™s contract address eg: 0xE8a8f1D76625B03b787F6ED17bD746e0515F3aEf|
| balance      | Historical balances raw data. 0.1 ETH should be 100000000000000000 |


## Data Format & Submission
Guidelines on how to generate and format data in the required CSV format for submission.

### CSV Format Specification
Required fields, referencing to:
```typescript 
    type OutputDataSchemaRow = {
        userAddress: string;
        tokenAddress: string;
        poolAddress: string;
        balance: string; 
    };
```

## 5.2 Testing & Validation
Teams can use these test scripts to validate the csv results such that it meets our requirements.

```bash
cd src/adapters/<project folder>/ && node ../testScript.js <project folder>
```
We will conduct a sampling verification of your CSV results. Teams are required to provide detailed methods of verification, including the approach and information utilized in the verification process.

Teams should submit some transactions, data reference on the **blockchain explorer** or **analytics platform** such as **Defillama** and a detailed verification method etc. We will utilize the data or tools provided you have provided to verify the accuracy and authenticity of the on-chain data.

We will facilitate our comparison of the provided data against the data provided in the generated CSV.

Important Note: If we are unable to verify the authenticity of CSV data, then the PR will be rejected.
